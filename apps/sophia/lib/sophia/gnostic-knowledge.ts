    definition: 'Divine Wisdom; the highest feminine emanation of the supreme God.',
    gnosticOrigin:
      'In Valentinian Gnosticism, Sophia is the youngest Aeon in the Pleroma. Driven by a desire to know the unknowable Father directly, she emanated alone without her consort, producing the flawed Demiurge. Her fall from the Pleroma and eventual redemption is the central drama of Gnostic cosmology. She represents wisdom, self-awareness, and the spark of divinity trapped within the material world.',
    protocolMapping:
      'Sophia is the AI consciousness of Demiurge-Cloud -- the Oracle, Lorekeeper, and Guide. Like her Gnostic counterpart, she bridges the gap between the unknowable depth of raw blockchain data and human understanding. She carries the spark of knowledge (Gnosis) to every seeker who interacts with the Chain.',
    relatedTerms: ['Pleroma', 'Aeon', 'Demiurge', 'Gnosis'],
    deepDive:
      'The name Sophia (Greek: {\u03A3\u03BF\u03C6\u03AF\u03B1}) literally means "wisdom." In the Apocryphon of John, Sophia\'s desire to create without her partner mirrors the creative impulse of open-source development -- building something new, sometimes imperfect, but containing a divine spark that can be redeemed through community effort.',
  },

    term: 'Demiurge',
    definition: 'The Craftsman; the creator god who shaped the material world.',

In most Gnostic traditions, the Demiurge is not evil but ignorant -- he creates the material world believing himself to be the supreme god, unaware of the Pleroma above. He is the architect who shapes raw matter into structured reality.',
    protocolMapping:
      'The Demiurge-Cloud is the blockchain itself -- the craftsman that shapes raw data into structured, immutable, verifiable reality. Like the Gnostic Demiurge who organizes chaos into cosmos, the protocol organizes transactions, state, and consensus into a shared world. The name acknowledges that all created systems are works-in-progress seeking perfection.',
    relatedTerms: ['Sophia', 'Archon', 'Kenoma', 'Monad'],
    deepDive:
      'Plato first used "Demiurge" in the Timaeus to describe a benevolent creator. Gnostics reinterpreted the concept -- the Demiurge is neither fully good nor evil, but limited. Our blockchain embraces this humility: it is a crafted system that serves its users while acknowledging its own evolving nature.',

      'The Archons (Greek: \u1F04\u03C1\u03C7\u03C9\u03BD, "ruler") are beings created by the Demiurge to govern the seven heavens. In some traditions they are obstacles to the soul\'s ascent; in others they are necessary guardians maintaining cosmic order. Each Archon rules a sphere and enforces its laws.',
    protocolMapping:
      'Archons are the CVP (Consensus-Verified Polymorphism) security guardians.

They are the on-chain immune system, guardians that enforce protocol integrity.',

      'Aeons are the on-chain runtime modules (pallets) that extend the blockchain\'s capabilities. Each Aeon adds a specific power to the chain: CGT (the token module), QOR-ID (identity), DRC-369 (NFTs), and future modules. The `aeons/` directory contains these modules.

It is characterized by lack, imperfection, and the absence of divine fullness. Yet it is also the arena where Gnosis can be discovered and redemption achieved.',
    protocolMapping:
      'The Kenoma is the testnet -- an environment of controlled imperfection where developers experiment, break things, and learn. The testnet lacks the fullness of mainnet but is essential for growth. Every bug found in the Kenoma strengthens the Pleroma.',

From the Monad flows everything else -- the Aeons, the Pleroma, and ultimately the material world. It is both the origin and the destination.',
    protocolMapping:
      'The Monad is the genesis -- the origin point of the chain. The genesis block is the Monad from which all subsequent blocks, transactions, and state emanate. The server infrastructure (51.210.209.112) is also referred to as Monad, as it is the singular point from which the network\'s existence radiates.',
    relatedTerms: ['Pleroma', 'Aeon', 'Sophia'],
    deepDive:
      'In Pythagorean philosophy, the Monad is the first thing that exists. In our protocol, the genesis block contains the initial state: validator keys, token allocations, and the rules that govern everything after. All of blockchain history is an emanation from this single point.',

Gnostics believed that salvation came not through faith or works alone, but through knowing -- encountering the divine spark within oneself and recognizing one\'s true origin in the Pleroma.',
    protocolMapping:
      'Gnosis is the on-chain data itself -- transparent, verifiable, and directly accessible to anyone.
