# ADR-016: Unlocking the vault signs in to QOR ID without a second approval

**Status:** Accepted, 14 September 2026, under the project owner's delegation. The owner asked for sign-in
and sign-up with as little friction as possible, without weakening security, and left the design to the
assistant. **Amended by [ADR-055](ADR-055-the-vault-opens-with-windows-hello-alone.md)** (28 September 2026, the
owner): there is no passphrase, and the approval below is given by the Windows Hello gesture that opens the
vault. **Amended again by [ADR-056](ADR-056-no-lock-screen.md)** the same day: the vault opens with nothing asked,
so the grant rests on the person being signed in to their computer, and the launcher no longer waits for QOR ID.
The decision stands otherwise.
**Narrows:** roadmap item L1.4 in [`DIRECTION.md`](../DIRECTION.md), host-side confirmation before any
signature, by one named exception. Every other part of L1.4 stands.

## Context

The launcher has two layers, and until this decision the person met both as separate logins:
- **The vault** is local key custody: the recovery phrase, sealed on this device with Argon2id and
  XChaCha20-Poly1305 and opened by a passphrase. Nothing is sent anywhere when it opens.
- **QOR ID** is the account on the identity service. With a vault key, signing in means answering a
  one-time challenge with a signature, so the service never holds anything reusable.

Under L1.4 every signature needs approval in a dialog the host draws. A returning person therefore typed
the passphrase, pressed "Sign in with your vault key", and approved a dialog: three acts for one intent.
A new person created the vault, went to the sign-in screen, chose "Claim one", entered a name and approved
a dialog.

The owner's question was why there are two logins at all. The layers are both needed. The steps are not.

## Decision

**Typing the correct passphrase is the approval for signing in.**

- Unlocking or creating the vault opens an **arrival grant** for the vault's first account.
- While the grant is open, that account answers QOR ID challenges, at sign-in and when claiming a name,
  without a dialog.
- The grant closes when a QOR ID session is established, when the vault locks, or five minutes after it
  opened, whichever comes first.
- The launcher uses it at once. Unlocking keeps a QOR ID session that is still valid, and otherwise signs
  in with the key. If the key has no QOR ID yet, the only thing left to ask is a name.
- **Nothing else uses the grant.** Transfers, starter-grant claims, wallet links, endpoint changes and test
  suite runs each keep their dialog. An identity signature outside the grant, such as a key sign-in after
  QOR ID was unreachable at unlock, asks as before.

The result: a returning person types a passphrase and is in. A new person writes down the phrase, sets a
passphrase and chooses a name.

## Why this does not weaken security

- **The passphrase is a stronger approval than the dialog.** It is the secret that opens the vault; the
  dialog is a button. The grant exists only because the passphrase was just typed correctly.
- **What the grant can sign is narrow.** A QOR ID challenge carries the domain tag
  `demiurge:qor-id:challenge:v1:`, and the launcher refuses to sign anything that is not in the service's
  challenge format. Such a signature cannot move CGT or authorise anything but a session on the configured
  identity service, and changing that service still needs a dialog.
- **The worst a compromised webview gains is small and bounded.** Inside the five-minute window after an
  unlock, it could sign the person in to their own account, or claim a name for a key that has none. It
  cannot obtain the key, a transfer, or any signature once the window closes.

## Alternatives considered

- **Opening the vault without a passphrase, with the operating system holding the key that unlocks it.**
  Rejected as a default: anyone who can use the person's operating-system account would open the vault.
  An opt-in unlock with Windows Hello or Touch ID, which checks that the person is present, is a possible
  later decision.
- **A PIN for switching accounts.** Rejected. Every account in a vault comes from one recovery phrase and
  unlocks with it, so a PIN between them protects nothing. A PIN that opened a vault would be far easier to
  guess than the passphrase.
- **No dialog for any identity signature.** Rejected: a compromised webview could then obtain identity
  signatures at any time while the vault is unlocked, not only in the moments after the person typed the
  passphrase.

## Consequences

- The Gate shows one field to a returning person, and a name field to a new one. The sign-in screen
  remains only as the fallback when QOR ID cannot be reached at unlock, or for accounts that use a
  password.
- L1.4's roadmap text names this exception. Exercising L1.4 in a running launcher now includes unlocking
  with no dialog, and a key sign-in outside the grant that still asks.
- An account picker would extend the grant to the account the person picks. That is for its own roadmap
  item.
