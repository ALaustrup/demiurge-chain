/**
 * First-run orientation.
 *
 * # The problem this solves
 *
 * First-run feedback was: "I was unsure what was actually going on within my
 * dashboard." That is the most serious kind of interface failure, and it was
 * earned. The Nexus opened onto a standing title, a progression track, a
 * holdings figure and six abstract category names, none of which mean anything
 * to someone who has never used the platform. Every one of those is useful *once
 * you know what it is*, which is precisely the knowledge a first-time user does
 * not have.
 *
 * The fix is not more chrome. It is answering, in plain words and before
 * anything else, the three questions a newcomer actually has:
 *
 *   1. What is this thing I am looking at?
 *   2. Is any of this going to cost me something or move my money?
 *   3. What should I do first?
 *
 * The third is the one that converts confusion into momentum, so it is a button,
 * not a sentence, and it points at the next verifiable rite rather than a generic
 * tour.
 *
 * It disappears once dismissed or once the basics are done, and can be summoned
 * again from the Nexus header, because an orientation you cannot get back is a
 * trap for anyone who dismissed it too early.
