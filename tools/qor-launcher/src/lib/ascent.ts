/**
 * The Ascent: the launcher's progression track.
 *
 * # Why this is not XP
 *
 * The easy version of a gamified launcher awards points for opening it. That is
 * transparent to anyone worth keeping, and it trains people to ignore the
 * progression entirely because none of it means anything.
 *
 * Every rite below is instead a **claim about the world that the launcher can
 * verify**: a vault file exists, an account has a non-zero nonce, the chain
 * answered. Nothing is stored, nothing is awarded, and nothing can be gamed
 * without actually doing the thing. The progression is a readout of your real
 * standing in the ecosystem, which is the only kind that stays interesting past
 * the first week.
 *
 * It doubles as onboarding. The next incomplete rite is always the next useful
 * thing to do, so a new arrival is never staring at a launcher wondering where
 * to start.
