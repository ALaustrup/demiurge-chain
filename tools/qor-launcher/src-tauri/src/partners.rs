//! Who this machine has traded with (L4.5).
//!
//! # Local, and only local
//!
//! There is no indexer (ADR-028), so nothing can ask the chain "who have I
//! traded with?" — a Substrate node answers questions about state, not about a
//! history. This file is the launcher's own memory of the trades it sent: an
//! address, what to call it, when it was last used and how often. It is written
//! only after a trade the chain finalised, so it records what happened rather
//! than what was attempted.
//!
//! **It never leaves this machine.** It is not published, not synchronised and
//! not sent to QOR ID; a person who wants their trading history private need
//! only delete the file, and the launcher rebuilds it from nothing.
//!
//! When the directory lookup exists, `label` holds the QOR ID a person typed,
//! so the list reads as names rather than addresses. Until then it is empty and
//! the interface shortens the address itself.
